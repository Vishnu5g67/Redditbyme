[Post in r/newyorkcity]: I feel violated by intern season
There's this bar that I frequent a few blocks away from my house. Technically different neighborhood, but generally has a mature vibe with people who like music and to dance. Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party. I thought that I must have been hallucinating, but Then a girl pointed at me and referred to me as the old person. That's when I knew I had to get out of there.
 I was at the wrong party. 

As I walk back home, all of a sudden I realize that there were now tens of thousands of 18 year-old 19 year-old 20-year-olds who were all living on top of each other and were super young and horny to basically use the New York nightlife as their own personal orgy dome.
 Naturally I felt violated

But then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. 
New York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city.

[Post in r/VisionPro]: Would you guys like to see Pokemon Go in AVP?
Hi guys,

I think Pokemon could be one of the killer use case for the vision pro. Imagine, you could fight players from around the world from the comfort of your couch. With the recent controversy around Palworld, they're looking for the next "Pokemon Go" that would propel their franchise to the next level.

Being Japanese, I happen to know a few key decision makers both in the Pokemon Company as well as Niantic. Alot of the in-game designs are transferrable, and I believe it's a matter of time until Niantic's Lightship ARDK will work on AVP.

*What should I tell them? Lmk if you have thoughts or useful links/videos I should forward to them.*

I'm confident that this will eventually become a thing, but the faster they ship the more AVP adoption we'll see.

[Post in r/VisionPro]: Can you actually “work” in AVP?
I’m curious if people have been able to fully port their workflow into AVP.

I’ve been trying to actually use the Vision Pro to get some work done, but without github and visual studio code, it’s not been the easiest (also obviously no terminal). I could use Mac virtual display, but since I have a M1 MBP the latency is noticeable to the point it’s an adverse experience. I already dropped $4k on this device, renewing my MBP just so I can use it with my AVP is asking a bit too much…

Also where’s Xcode? If Apple wants AVP to be a “work device”, they gotta have at least Xcode right?

I can get the simple stuff like emails done through AVP, but if this device can’t replace my entire workflow, I don’t know if I can justify the price. I’m sure it’ll get resolved down the line (more of a software issue than hardware constraints), but curious to hear how realistic it is for people to port over their workflow to AVP, and what apps you’d like to see ASAP.

[Post in r/OnePiece]: 【Theory】 What if we live in the void 800 century
Let’s say the WG is the current western civilization. 

The birth of Western history is in the Middle East, specifically Iraq (Nippur). Which is why the west, led by the US, has been trying to cause instability, and destroy historical artifacts. That way, the true history of how the WG came to be won’t come into light. Like, archaeology is basically using artifacts discovered and interpreting it a certain way. The whole concept is something that mostly grew into a concept in the UK around 1824. 1824 is the year the Oxford English Dictionary defined "archaeology" a word.

(Btw our generation will be remembered for our new additions which include anti-work, curry laksa, diet-busting, final frontier, fugazi, gajillion, skellington, straight-talking, stonkingly, voguing,etc.)

Back to the main topic, what I’m saying is that it’s pretty easy for the “1%” to control the “story of our world” through archeologists and historians. These have traditionally been an activity for the rich and remains that way. Like, who tries to become a historian unless they have trust funds?

So yeah, maybe the history we are told on a daily basis is pretty different from reality, and Oda is trying to tell us this message.

What are pacifistas? They're our modern comparable to AI. They will be the ultimate, infinite, obedient, power between the celestial dragons (also known as the 1%) and us normal humans.

So who is our Nika? Who is our Joy Boy? are we too early to hear the drums of liberation, or do we actually all have our own drums of liberation?

[Post in r/ClimateOffensive]: Tracking our individual impacts on the world through ESG ratings
&#x200B;

[Mock-up of ESG scores ](https://preview.redd.it/btc0a5nqmhjb1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=13920d7c88791b2579b6167e5fe135a136731ef7)

&#x200B;

We've had ESG ratings for decades now, but it hasn't  played a significant role in the eyes of the consumer. Sure it has developed new investing policies and has made some impact from the shareholder side, but as someone who's worked in environmental consulting, I felt that we needed a more direct way of getting ESG ratings into the mass conscience.

**Do you think individuals should be aware of our own ESG rating?**

I feel that companies would take ESG ratings  seriously if consumers changed their purchase behaviors based on the score.

The current method of consumer activism has yielded lackluster results. This is because once the news dies down, consumers forget about the scandal and go back to normal purchasing behavior. In addition, companies aren't really incentivized to make changes, since consumers hear about the scandal, but rarely stay informed about what was done about it.

The first step towards voting with our dollars is to be aware of our current ESG impact. This can be approximated through the ESG score of the companies you are purchasing goods/services from, multiplied by the dollar amount of your purchase. [Sustainalytics](https://www.sustainalytics.com/) has a comprehensive ESG rating for most public companies. For purchases from businesses that are private (and doesn't have any ESG rating), we can approximate from comparable public companies, or use other indicators (BCorp, Fair Trade, etc.)

Please let me know what you think!

Individual ESG scores could elevate sustainable conscience to another level, which would lead to climate activism on a larger scale.

[Post in r/Frugal]: How do you decide what to buy and not buy?
I've been lurking in this channel for a while now, and have been greatly inspired by the ways people have found ways to stretch their money. This got me thinking, is there a way to develop a mental model on what we buy or don't buy?

I feel that most people decide what to buy based on past experiences, gut feeling, or the mood of that day. But is there a way to better understand what we get our "gratification" from, and track this?

My initial idea was an app that would enable users to track the "gratification" they receive from their purchases. If you regret what you bought, you can record a decline in the gratification, or if you found the purchase better than you expected, you can record an increase.

Of course, this would not necessarily apply to all purchases. Some things (rent, insurance, etc.) do not yield any gratification scores, but many purchases (clothes, going out, etc.) could.

&#x200B;

Would love to hear how you make your purchase decisions, and if there's a mental model you follow!

(photo is a mockup of the idea I'm working on)

[Post in r/Webull]: 50k at a time?

[Post in r/stocks]: Still buying options?
I’ve been trading options for the past month or so, and have made good money. But I’ve realized recently that many put options have become quite expensive, to the point that the market has to crash HARD to make great gains. What’s everyone’s move now, since it seems that the looming economic recession is more “priced in” compared to before?

[Post in r/options]: Seeking advice: I’ve made some gains buying put options this month, but I’ve not been doing call option spread. Option spread limits risk, but also limits profitability. I know in a normal economic scenario it makes sense, but are spreads still recommended when we can’t see the bottom of the market?

[Comment in r/ManorLords]: Sorry to hear that man, in the future you may want to have multiple granaries, one close to your berries/deer/fish and one for your veggies/apples/honey.
Also I just store ale at the tavern or keep it in the brewery for this reason

[Comment in r/ManorLords]: Yeah but it doesn’t seem to affect much though

[Comment in r/ChatGPT]: Incredible stuff! How did you maintain character consistency? Did you generate a consistent character image and then use the image-to-video feature?

[Comment in r/ManorLords]: I do too but I rarely finish a game haha. Too little late game content

[Comment in r/ManorLords]: I do too but I rarely finish a game haha. Too little late game content

[Comment in r/ManorLords]: You have to kill the bandit units, or donate crop yields though the manor (tithing, different from taxation).

[Comment in r/ManorLords]: That proximity is ridiculous, deep mining, two fishing huts, vegetable, orchards, and trade iron for malt.
imo trading raw materials is easier than trading crafted goods in the current build. High quantity stuff is easy to stock, and you could have multiple trading posts up without any major issues.
The exact opposite of this is plate armor. It takes forever to build, requires three points, and needs eight iron slabs to make it. It’s cheaper to just export the ore, and since it’s a low quantity trade, it’s hard to stick multiple trade posts with it

[Comment in r/ManorLords]: Yeah I was doing alright and then as soon as I upgraded to tier 3 my town was in shambles. I didn’t notice how demanding it was going to be

[Comment in r/ManorLords]: So in general each family will eat each type of food equally. Which means those with low supply are more likely to be consumed first.

Eggs I believe each plot only produces one per month, so it's helpful, but won't be sufficient to maintain food diversity

[Comment in r/ManorLords]: I build my cities close to the borders of others, that way I'm not managing multiple cities at once. The best is building it at the three-way border. That way you're basically managing three cities at once.

[Comment in r/NFT]: \- the hype has definitely faded, you can see that with the price as well as the number of people discussing it on X, or even here  
\- haven't seen much innovation in the space at all, the momentum seems to have shifted to solana memecoins, and dissipated after that  
\- again, people no longer seem interested. I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well  
\- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.  
\- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT

I see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead

Any tips for photo realism would be appreciated!

[Comment in r/civ5]: Can’t really discuss this without your strategy. If you’re setting up on the coast over river, your strategy must involve maritime trades. Also means you benefit from other cities being on the coast. It also means you need some navy to protect your shipping routes and coastal cities. 

[Comment in r/ChatGPTJailbreak]: imagine making 60fps videos with photos from OAI images. nothing on the internet can be trusted

[Comment in r/AskNYC]: Daytime bathhouse

[Comment in r/civ5]: This happens when you are in an advanced technological era than the AI. You can adjust to only give them gold, or other resources which you might not need (e.g. iron/coal).

[Comment in r/AskReddit]: Would you be interested in a trade agreement with England?

[Comment in r/ChatGPT]: Sounds like X

[Comment in r/warriors]: He used to shoot well and have impact when no one had him on the radar, and opponents didn’t have him on their scouting report.
Now that there’s pressure to perform, and opponents develop plans on how to deal with him, he’s not doing so well.

Really shows how hard it is to perform when the lights are bright and people are counting on your 3s

[Comment in r/AskNYC]: Not in Chelsea but Washington square park has the pigeon whisperer. Bear in mind he’s definitely eccentric and curses a lot so might not be a family friendly guy to talk to.
Also the corner of 46th and 6Av always has insane number of pigeons. Like a lot.
